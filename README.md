# Quake II Pokémon Mod

This project is a **Quake II total conversion mod** that implements a **Pokémon-style monster battle system**, using existing monsters from Quake II as collectible and battleable units.

## Concept

Instead of capturing fictional creatures, the player collects and battles with iconic Quake II monsters. Each monster has:

- Four unique moves
- Balanced damage values
- Some with status effects (Burn, Poison, Paralyze, Sleep, Confused)
- A dedicated inventory system to store your collected monsters

## Features

- Turn-based monster battles modeled after Pokémon
- Five monsters have unique status-effect moves
- Monster stats and moves based on logical balance and lore
- Items are turned into Pokémon Items 

## Monster List

The following monsters are implemented as collectible units:

- `monster_soldier_light`
- `monster_soldier_ss`
- `monster_soldier`
- `monster_gunner`
- `monster_berserk`
- `monster_parasite`
- `monster_brain`
- `monster_tank`
- `monster_gladiator`
- `monster_mutant`
